    <p align="center">
    75 images of apple fruits were employed to evaluate the performance of the proposed network. A majority of the apples are infected with a disease called Anthracnose. The symptom of the disease generally appears rounded with varying sizes and shows visible variations of patterns within the disease. An experienced expert annotated the region of such rounded symptoms on apple fruits with bounding boxes, serving as ground-truth labels for this study. The total number of the bounding boxes is 182, ranging from 1 to 9 per image. The size of apple images ranges from 500x700 to 3000x2000 and the size of disease symptoms ranges from 50x50 to 2000x1400.

## Region Aggregated Attention CNN for Disease Detection in Fruit Images

        <strong>background:</strong>
        <p>Microsatellite instability (MSI), caused by a defective DNA mismatch repair system, has both prognostic and therapeutic implications in colorectal cancer (CRC).MSI is determined by using five microsatellite markers, including D2S123, D5S346, D17S250, BAT25, and BAT26.
        <ul>
            <li>MSI-High (MSI-H; instability at â‰¥ 2 microsatellite markers)</li>
            <li>MSI-Low (MSI-L; instability at 1 marker)</li>
            <li>MSI-Stable (MSS; microsatellite stable or no instability)</li></ul>

           <ul>
                <li>The training dataset contains 47 WSIs</li>
                <li>The validation dataset contains 31 WSIs</li>
                <li>The test dataset contains 40 WSIs</li>
                <p>
                    All WSIs were scanned at 40X magnification and all cases are randomly selected irrespective of the participating institutions.
